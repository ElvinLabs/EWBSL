        <p>
       4th International Conference on Structural Engineering and Construction  Management was successfully held from the 13th to 15th of December 2013 at Earl’s Regency Hotel, Kandy celebrating the innovative research and novel experiences associated to a number of topics under 10 parallel sessions related to Construction and Engineering. The conference commenced with an inaugural ceremony held on the 13th at the Congress Hall with over 200
distinguished guests in Earl’s Regency and graced by Deshamanya Dr. Roland Silva, the former chancellor of the University of Moratuwa.<br><br>

This prestigious International Conference was attended by over 400  participants and graced by 9 keynote lecturers. The conference was also  furnished successful by around 150 presenting authors who took the time and effort to help us create an equal platform where engineers and other  professionals could exchange their expertise for the betterment of the world.<br><br>

The keynoters included Professor Patrick Selvadurai, Professor Surender P. Shah, Professor Manjriker Gunaratne, Mr.Helarisi Abeyruwan, Professor Edward Jasselskis, Professor Thameed Al- Hussaini, Professor Alex  Remmenikov, Professor Mamdouh El Badry and Professor Mahen Mahendran who are all experts in their various respective fields. The keynote lectures were spread out over for all three days all throughout the conference.<br><br>

The conference was Co Chaired by Professor Ranjith Dissanayake, Professor Priyan Mendis, Professor Thishan Jayasinghe, Professor Janaka Ruwanpura and Eng. Shiromal Fernando.  The principal sponsors for the event were Melwa and Holcim Lanka PLC. ICSECM 2013 was brought forth as a joint  venture of University of Peradeniya, University of Moratuwa and University of Ruhuna. It shaped a common platform upon which various individuals of  various areas of research interests could exchange their knowledge and gain more in order to enrich their own research interests.<br><br>

The  parallel sessions were conducted under the topics of Coastal Structures, Advanced Materials, Construction Management, Structural Health Monitoring, Urban Water monitoring and Management, High Performance Concrete,  Earthquake Engineering, Engineers without Borders, Construction Materials and systems, Sustainable Design, Loading Effects, Green Buildings,Develoment of Seismic Map for Sri Lanka, Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat and Structural Solid Mechanics. The entire conference was based on the  concept of Structural engineering and Construction management under which those were the selected topics of conversation.<br><br>

The primary work for the conference began since January this year where  abstracts and full paper submissions kick started the work for the  Organizing Committee. The papers were reviewed by an advisory panel  comprising of many high ranking engineering academics. The final program  included around 130 camera ready paper presentations of 12 minutes each. Each presenting author was awarded 3 minutes discussion session. The  keynote lectures were 30 minutes duration. Thus the conference created an  excellent hub of engineering knowledge to be exchanged.<br><br>

ICSECM being the 4th of its line of a highly successful series of conferences held since December 2010 saw a higher partaking of many foreign  academics that were all too pliant in their contribution. The local  contribution was even better where many government and private  establishments produced their employees as participants. Thus the conference was attended by over 600 participants within the three days.<br><br>

Opening Ceremony and the technical sessions were ended with a cultural show and 2 grand dinners making space for the participants to enjoy the Sri Lankan food and to explore the culture.  The closing ceremony was held on 15th December and followed by a tour to Sigiriya, with the participation of foreign delegates. </p>
